            <h4>Perfect Fit (passive)</h3>
            <p>"Yuki stores cufflinks as a resource. Upon damaging an enemy, he consumes a stored cufflink, dealing additional true damage. Yuki recovers 1 cufflink every 4 seconds while out of combat. Activating Button Up will refill all of his cufflinks."</p>
            <p>Perfect Fit allows yuki to dish out extra damage to enemeys when he has cufflinks avalible.His Q skill also has a bonus effect if used with a cufflink.Its very important to use your w when out of cufflinks as this will aslo relepshi them while making you take less damage.</p>

            <p><img src="findapic and put it in folder.jpg" alt="i need to find a picture hehe"></p>
            <h4>From Head to Toe(Q)</h4>
            <p>"Yuki's next normal attack deals damage and reduces the movement speed of enemies by 50% for 1 second.
                Consuming a cufflink stuns enemies for 0.5 seconds."</p>
            <p> From head to Toe is a great engage skill as it slows the enemy on hit by 50% or stuns them if you have a cufflink up. Make sure to start a fight with this skill when you have cufflinks to get free attacks off when you stun them.</p>

            <h4>Button Up (W) </h4>
            <p>Passive: reduces cooldown of Button Up by 0.5 seconds each time Yuki takes damage.
                Yuki straightens up his outfit and reduces the cooldown for Dashing Gentleman by 4/5/6/7/8. While using Button Up, his defense is increased by 50%. When Button Up is complete, he refills his cufflinks."</p>
            <p>Button Up is one of yukis play maker skills. Being able to reduce incoming damage as well as reduce the cooldown of your dash ability makes this skill very imporntant. You can use this as part of your combo to get your e and cufflinks back and output more damage or you can use it in a losing fight to get a second dash away to try to lose your opponents.</p>

            <p><img src="findapic and put it in folder.jpg" alt="i need to find a picture hehe"></p>
            <h4>Dashing Gentleman (E)</h4>
            <p>"Yuki dashes in the targeted direction, dealing damage to the first enemy hit. Enemies hit are disarmed, disabling their normal attacks."</p>
            <p>Dashing Gentleman is the keystone of yukis playstyle. as said in the skill discription this is a dash that does damage and prevents normal attacks. this can be used to engage or diengagee as well as reposition in a fight to dodge attacks.what makes this skill so powerfull is not even the skill itself its the fact that you can reduce its cooldown with W. later in the game when you have lower cooldowns you can almost cast two dashes back to back instititly for crazy chasing potental.</p>

            <p><img src="findapic and put it in folder.jpg" alt="i need to find a picture hehe"></p>
            <h4>Coup de Grace (R)</h4>
            <p>"Yuki unsheaths his sword and slashes an area in front of him, dealing damage to enemies and leaving a mark, reducing movement speed of enemies by 70% for 1 second. The mark explodes after Yuki sheathes his sword, dealing true damage based on the enemy's max HP."</p>
            <p>Yukis R is a very powerfull strike if it connectes with the enemey,but can be dodged becouse of the cast time of the 2nd part. In order to increase your odds of landing your r you should use your Q with a cufflink as it will stun them for .5 seconds then click r. This small stun could be the differnce between them dashing/walking(depeding on enemny) out of the 2nd cast and misisng most of your damage or getting hit by it.</p>

            <h4> Parry</h4>
            <p>"Block all damage for a certain time, and return the damage to the attacking enemy."</p>
            <p>Yuki uses a two handed sword as his weapon and once he hits mastery 7 on it he unlocks the skill parry. this is a huge part of his kit as it allows him to make so many outplays. With this sinlge skill you are able to block damage from anyone in the game.This alone can help you win fights againts players that are better geared or higher level then you.</p>

            <h4>Iteam Build</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hovud (Two-handed sword)</li>
                <li>Optical Camouflage Suit (Chest)</li>
                <li>Crystal Tiara (Head)</li>
                <li>Creed of the Knight (Arm)</li>
                <li>Bucephalus (Leg)</li>
                <li>Flower of Fate (Accessory)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These iteams allow yuki to get to 100% crit meaning all of his attacks will do increased damamge.On top of that the arms allow for extra crit damage. so instead of his attacks dealing 200% damage they do 220%</p>

            <h4>Pathing Route</h4>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Alley</li>
                <li>Pond</li>
                <li>Avenue</li>
                <li>Hotel</li>
                <li>Dock</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Pathing is pretty stright forward as you go from zone to zone collecting the iteams you need for your build.as you get more comfetbale with your charcter you can look at other zones that have the iteams you need to see where else you can go if you are finding youself unlucky in fidning iteams. On top of that a big tip around pathing is if you see that one zone you need to go into has alot of people dropping there you should start there and get as much stuff as you can as you walk to your other zones becouse iteams only spawn in a limted number of times a game so you dont want people to get them all before you.</p>

        <article class="Sum">
            <h4>Summuary</h4>
            <p>Skill order R>E>W>Q>P</p>
            <p>Above is the order you should level up your skills R whenever you can and then e w q and the passive in that order. With this build you will become strong in the mid to late game once you start getting all your iteams and have alot of points into your e and w. This allows you to dash around fast with resets and pumping out alot of damage. It will take sometime to figure out game to game situations on how to complete your iteams and where to farm but with practice you should be able to give anyone on the isladn a run for there money with this build.</p>
