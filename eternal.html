            <h2> Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Eternal Return is a Top down MOBA battle royal. There is 18+ characters all with different abilities and items to use and loot. The name of the game is to be the last person on the experiment island to do this you must walk around looting for items and weapons to build yourself gear that amplifies your skills.AS you walk around you will notice mobs (AI animals) you can fight to get more loot and xp. On top of looting and crafting items another major aspect of the game is your mastery. Every character can use specific types of weapons and these weapons have a mastery. The higher-level mastery it has the better the stats are for the weapon. For example, two players could have the same build and fight each other at the same level but if one player is higher in weapon mastery, they would easily win the fight as their weapon would deal more damage. To level this up you have to fight other players or mobs each instant of damage or player kill will add xp to this mastery. The last important aspect of the gameplay is the zones. Every so often zones close on the map and become yellow. When a zone is yellow it means players will only have a limited time in this zone before it turns red. Once a zone turns red it’s considered closed off. If a player is in a closed off zone, they will see a timer count down from 30. If this timer hits zero, they will die immediately. One thing to note is that this timer does not reset after leaving the red zone. so if you leave one with 5 seconds left you only have 5 seconds to walkaround in any red zone for the rest of that game. </p>

            <h2>Generic Iteams</h2>
            <P>In a game like this there are generic items that everyone should know how to make like food and SP increasers (sp stands for skill points and is used like mana to loot and use abilities) as well as character specific items. In this section I’ll be talking about the health items you can craft around the map and dive more into the character specific ones when I talk about specific characters. When talking about generic items in eternal return, we are talking about health and SP items. These are more easily depicted as food and drinks. When the game starts you start off with two pieces of bread and 2 bottles of water. these provide the lowest amount of heath and SP regen. and need to be crafted into better items with other items around the map. The easiest way to do this is when lotting grab any items that look related to food 9/10 times they will craft into some food like product. meat from animals and bread makes an easy tier two hamburger. As well as adding ice to your water to create a tier two drink. As you keep crafting better food items the rarity will increase from grey to green to blue to purple. the higher the rarity the faster and more efficiency these food items or drinks will heal or increase your SP. Make sure to keep your inventory stacked with food and drink so you are able to keep up your health and be at the upper hand in closer fights when that little amount of hp regen could be the difference in winning and losing a fight.</P>
